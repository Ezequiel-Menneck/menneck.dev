          <p className="mb-6 text-xl">
            I am a dedicated programmer whose passion for technology began early
            in life. I started working at the age of 14, developing qualities
            like responsibility and resilience that have shaped my career. While
            Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by technology, it was in 2020, when I
            began my degree in Information Systems, that I fully immersed myself
            in the tech world and started building my expertise.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-xl">
            Since then, I have honed my skills in Java, Spring Boot, Angular,
            TypeScript, React, Golang, OCaml (learning by baby steps but I love
            functional programming) and web development, constantly expanding my
            knowledge in programming, databases, and system design. My journey
            has been defined by a proactive and curious mindset, always eager to
            tackle challenges and find innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-xl">
            I am driven by a constant pursuit of knowledge and innovation,
            qualities that have enabled me to acquire technical proficiency and
            strive for continuous improvement. My natural curiosity drives me to
            explore new technologies and methodologies, always aiming to add
            value to the team and the company I work for.
